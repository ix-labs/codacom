This project high depends on the C version of igraph (http://igraph.org/c/), and some optional components depend on the boost graph library and mcl.

Tested install on Ubuntu 14.04 (start in the root directory of the project) :
sudo apt-get install libigraph0 mcl
./configure
make

On OSX (see the igraph documentation for more information on homebrew):
brew install homebrew/science/igraph
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
make

Note : if the "make" command gives you an error with aclocal, try
touch configure.ac aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.am Makefile.in
And then rerun the configure and make.
